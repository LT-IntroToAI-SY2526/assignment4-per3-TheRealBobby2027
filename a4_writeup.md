# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
figuring out the win conditions and how to code was significantly hard to me, i didnt really understnad much apart from how classes work and the general idea and structure the code was following.


2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

I would remove the Player O anc change it to something like computer_o and have it figure out which * (blank spots) spot was most convinient, or if id just like to place it randomly id have it randomly select an open spot.


3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

i would likley use if/then (elif?) statements to have the computer understand what the best move is given the possible matchups that it could be facing, per se If, column 1 has two x's, place O in the third spot.
